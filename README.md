# My Portfolio Website

## Projects

1) Personal Porfolio Web Application - This Web App is my very first personal project. It was designed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that provides the user with an personal information about myself including files such as my resume.

2) Car Rental Web Application - This Web App contains my second personal project. The website is designed using HTML and CSS to provide users with an interface to explore available cars, make reservations, and learn more about the rental services.
Here is the link for the website: https://stompie222.github.io/Car-Rental-Website/

4) To-Do List Web Application - This Web App was my latest personal project. It provides a straightforward interface for managing tasks.  It includes adding and removing tasks, mark tasks as complete or not, and the user can choose to show all completed or incompleted tasks. Very user-friendly.
